# WordReference browser extension

This project was created out of frustration with
the [Google Translate](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-translate/aapbdbdomjkkjkaonfhkkikfgjllcleb) 
extension as I was not getting the results I expected to.

## TODO

- [X] Translate with context menu (on right click).
- [ ] Show Popup and translate on text select.
- [ ] Play accent audio on 🔊 button click.
- [ ] Translate multiple languages (Currently only english to greek).
- [ ] Multi browser support (Currently only chrome).
- [ ] Auto detect language to translate.
